# 🍔 MunchLox - A MERN Stack Food Delivery App

MunchLox is a **food delivery web application** built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.

## 🎯 Features  
- **User Authentication:** Signup and login functionality using JWT authentication.
- **Food Menu Display:** Users can view food items, their details, and add them to the cart.
